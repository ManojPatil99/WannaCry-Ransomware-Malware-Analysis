Welcome to FLARE-VM - a collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily setup and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine (VM). FLARE-VM was designed to solve the problem of reverse engineering tool curation and relies on two main technologies: Chocolatey and Boxstarter. Chocolatey is a Windows-based Nuget package management system, where a "package" is essentially a ZIP file containing PowerShell installation scripts that download and configure a specific tool. Boxstarter leverages Chocolatey packages to automate the installation of software and create repeatable, scripted Windows environments.

Requirements
FLARE-VM should ONLY be installed on a virtual machine. The VM should satisfy the following requirements:

Windows >= 10
PowerShell >= 5
Disk capacity of at least 60 GB and memory of at least 2GB
Usernames without spaces or other special characters
Internet connection
Tamper Protection and any Anti-Malware solution (e.g., Windows Defender) Windows Defender disabled, preferably via Group Policy
Windows Updates Disabled

FLARE-VM installation
Open a PowerShell prompt as administrator
Download the installation script installer.ps1 to your Desktop:
(New-Object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1',"$([Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop"))\install.ps1")
Unblock the installation script:
Unblock-File .\install.ps1
Enable script execution:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
If you receive an error saying the execution policy is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope, you may need to pass a scope in via Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force. To view execution policies for all scopes, execute Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
Finally, execute the installer script as follow:
.\install.ps1
To pass your password as an argument: .\install.ps1 -password <password>
To use the CLI-only mode with minimal user interaction: .\install.ps1 -password <password> -noWait -noGui
To use the CLI-only mode with minimal user interaction and a custom config file: .\install.ps1 -customConfig <config.xml> -password <password> -noWait -noGui
After installation it is recommended to switch to host-only networking mode and take a VM snapshot

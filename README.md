# WannaCry-Ransomware-Malware-Analysis
Wanna Cry is a notorious ransomware strain that first emerged in May 2017, rapidly gaining global attention due to its unprecedented impact on both private and public sector organizations. This ransomware operates as a type of malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible, and subsequently demands a ransom payment to restore access. The Wanna Cry ransomware's significant notoriety stems from its rapid proliferation and the extensive disruption it caused across various sectors worldwide.
Wanna Cry primarily exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, specifically the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which allowed it to spread autonomously across networks. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-0144, was dubbed “Eternal Blue” and had been leaked from a trove of cyber tools allegedly developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Once a system was infected, Wanna Cry encrypted files and appended them with a .wncry extension.
The ransomware demanded payment in Bitcoin, threatening permanent data loss if the ransom was not paid within a specified time frame.
The ransomware's rapid spread was facilitated by a worm-like capability, enabling it to infect vulnerable systems without user interaction. This led to widespread disruptions, with numerous organizations experiencing significant operational setbacks.
Notably, the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom was among the high-profile victims, with the attack impacting numerous healthcare facilities and services.
The WannaCry incident highlighted critical vulnerabilities in cybersecurity practices and the importance of timely software updates and robust security measures. It served as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for ongoing vigilance in the protection of digital assets

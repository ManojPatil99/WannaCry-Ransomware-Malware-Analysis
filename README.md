# WannaCry-Ransomware-Malware-Analysis
Wanna Cry is a notorious ransomware strain that first emerged in May 2017, rapidly gaining global attention due to its unprecedented impact on both private and public sector organizations. This ransomware operates as a type of malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible, and subsequently demands a ransom payment to restore access. The Wanna Cry ransomware's significant notoriety stems from its rapid proliferation and the extensive disruption it caused across various sectors worldwide.

Wanna Cry primarily exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, specifically the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which allowed it to spread autonomously across networks. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-0144, was dubbed “Eternal Blue” and had been leaked from a trove of cyber tools allegedly developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Once a system was infected, Wanna Cry encrypted files and appended them with a .wncry extension.

The ransomware demanded payment in Bitcoin, threatening permanent data loss if the ransom was not paid within a specified time frame.
The ransomware's rapid spread was facilitated by a worm-like capability, enabling it to infect vulnerable systems without user interaction. This led to widespread disruptions, with numerous organizations experiencing significant operational setbacks.

Notably, the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom was among the high-profile victims, with the attack impacting numerous healthcare facilities and services.
The WannaCry incident highlighted critical vulnerabilities in cybersecurity practices and the importance of timely software updates and robust security measures. It served as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for ongoing vigilance in the protection of digital assets

Overview:
This project involves the in-depth analysis of the WannaCry ransomware, focusing on both static and dynamic analysis techniques. The objective was to understand the behavior, infection mechanism, and impact of the ransomware, as well as to develop effective mitigation strategies.

Steps Performed:

Sample Collection and Preparation:
Acquired WannaCry ransomware samples from a controlled environment.
Set up an isolated virtual lab environment to safely analyze the malware.

Static Analysis:
Analyzed the PE (Portable Executable) file structure.
Identified and unpacked the embedded resources and obfuscated code.
Extracted strings, API calls, and other IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) using tools like PEview, FLOSS, and YARA.

Dynamic Analysis:
Executed the ransomware in a sandbox environment to observe its behavior.
Monitored file system changes, registry modifications, and network traffic using tools like Procmon and Wireshark.
Analyzed the encryption process and identified the files targeted by the ransomware.

Network Traffic Analysis:
Captured and reviewed network traffic to identify the C2 (Command and Control) server communications.
Simulated a fake DNS server to analyze DNS requests made by the malware using INETSIM.

Mitigation and Defense:
Explored various methods to prevent infection and mitigate the impact of the ransomware.
Developed YARA rules for detecting WannaCry ransomware in network environments.
